# Community Guidelines
See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Principles

These principles guide our data, product, and process decisions, architecture, and approach.

- Open means transparent and participatory.
- We take a modular and modern approach to software development.
- We build open-source software and open-source process.
- We value ease of implementation.
- Fostering community includes building capacity and making our software and processes accessible to participants with diverse backgrounds and skillsets.
- Data (and data science) is as important as software and process. We build open data sets where possible.
- We strive for transparency for algorithms and places we might be introducing bias.
