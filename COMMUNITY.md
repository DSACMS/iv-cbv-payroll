## IV CBV Payroll Open Source Community Guidelines

This document contains principles and guidelines for participating in the IV CBV Payroll open source community.

### Principles

These principles guide our data, product, and process decisions, architecture, and approach.

- Open means transparent and participatory.
- We take a modular and modern approach to software development.
- We build open-source software and open-source process.
- We value ease of implementation.
- Fostering community includes building capacity and making our software and processes accessible to participants with diverse backgrounds and skillsets.
- Data (and data science) is as important as software and process. We build open data sets where possible.
- We strive for transparency for algorithms and places we might be introducing bias.

### Community Guidelines

All community members are expected to adhere to our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Information on contributing to this repository is available in our [Contributing file](CONTRIBUTING.md).

When participating in IV CBV Payroll open source community conversations and spaces, we ask individuals to follow the following guidelines:

- When joining a conversation for the first time, please introduce yourself by providing a brief intro that includes:
  - your related organization (if applicable)
  - your superpower, and how you hope to use it for IV CBV Payroll
- Embrace a culture of learning, and educate each other. We are all entering this conversation from different starting points and with different backgrounds. There are no dumb questions.
- Take space and give space. We strive to create an equitable environment in which all are welcome and able to participate. We hope individuals feel comfortable voicing their opinions and providing contributions and will do our best to recognize and make space for individuals who may be struggling to find space here. Likewise, we expect individuals to recognize when they are taking up significant space and take a step back to allow room for others.
<!-- TODO: Add if your repo has a community chat - Be present when joining synchronous conversations such as our community chat. Why be here if you're not going to _be here_? -->
- Be respectful.
- Default to positive. Assume others' contributions are legitimate and valuable and that they are made with good intention.

### Inactivity
It is important for contributors to be and stay active to set an example and show commitment to the project. Inactivity may lead to unexpected delays, contributor attrition, and a lost of trust in the project.
- Inactivity is measured by: 
  - Periods of no contributions for longer than 6 months.
  - Periods of no communication for longer than 6 months.
- Consequences of being inactive include: 
  - Transfer to Alumni status

### Involuntary Removal or Demotion
Involuntary removal/demotion of a contributor happens when responsibilities and requirements aren't being met. This may include repeated patterns of inactivity, extended periods of inactivity, a period of failing to meet the requirements of your role, and/or a violation of the Code of Conduct. This process is important because it protects the community and its deliverables while also opening up opportunities for new contributors to step in. 

Involuntary removal or demotion is handled through maintainers filing an issue using the contributor_ladder.md template, and sending a PR to the COMMUNITY.md file.

### Voluntary Stepping Down and Alumni Status
If and when maintainers' and contributors' commitment levels change, contributors can file an issue using the contributor_ladder.md template, and send a PR to the COMMUNITY.md file indicating their updated status.
