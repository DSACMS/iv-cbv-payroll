# Decisionmaking Process
All important team decisions should have an Architectural Decision Record (ADR) document that specifies the options considered and rationale for the recommended/decided option.

For ease of editing and collaboration, ADRs are stored in our project's CMS Confluence page: https://confluenceent.cms.gov/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=693666588

## Decision Log
Decisions made via ADR or otherwise should also be logged into the [Decision Log][1], sorted chronologically.
