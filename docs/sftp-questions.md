If your agency would like to receive output from EMMY in the form of a file uploaded to an SFTP endpoint, please get in touch with the EMMY team, with some answers to the following questions:

* Does your agency use any hosted file transfer platforms for data sharing between business units? (For example, SFTP, AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, or MOVEIt)
* Which team manages requests to provision/configure new storage locations of that system?
* What is the lead time like to get such a bucket? (If lead time is measured in months, is there anything we can do to expedite the proces?)
Is any security review/documentation necessary beyond the standard DSA? (Please send us the form.)
If we upload files [in this format](https://app.box.com/file/1817504471038), is that acceptable?
