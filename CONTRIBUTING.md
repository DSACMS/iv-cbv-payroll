# How to Contribute

This project is being developed by Digital Public Works in partnership with various agency partners. We use internal
tools to track our work (bugs and feature enhancements), and as such this repo is not architected to receive
public contributions.

<details>
<summary>Sections we will fill out once we open to external contributions</summary>
## Getting Started

### Team Specific Guidelines

<!-- TODO: This section helps contributors understand any team structure in the project (formal or informal.) Encouraged to point towards the MAINTAINERS.md file for further details.-->

### Building dependencies

<!--- TODO: This step is often skipped, so don't forget to include the steps needed to install on your platform. If you project can be multi-platform, this is an excellent place for first time contributors to send patches!-->

### Building the Project

<!--- TODO: Be sure to include build scripts and instructions, not just the source code itself! -->

### Workflow and Branching

<!--- TODO: Workflow Example
We follow the [GitHub Flow Workflow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)

1.  Fork the project
2.  Check out the `main` branch
3.  Create a feature branch
4.  Write code and tests for your change
5.  From your branch, make a pull request against `{{ cookiecutter.project_org }}/{{ cookiecutter.project_repo_name }}/main`
6.  Work with repo maintainers to get your change reviewed
7.  Wait for your change to be pulled into `{{ cookiecutter.project_org }}/{{ cookiecutter.project_repo_name }}/main`
8.  Delete your feature branch
-->

### Testing Conventions

<!--- TODO: Discuss where tests can be found, how they are run, and what kind of tests/coverage strategy and goals the project has. -->

### Coding Style and Linters

<!--- TODO: HIGHLY ENCOURAGED. Specific tools will vary between different languages/frameworks (e.g. Black for python, esliint for JavaScript, etc...)

1. Mention any style guides you adhere to (e.g. pep8, etc...)
2. Mention any linters your project uses (e.g. flake8, jslint, etc...)
3. Mention any naming conventions your project uses (e.g. Semantic Versioning, CamelCasing, etc...)
4. Mention any other content guidelines the project adheres to (e.g. plainlanguage.gov, etc...)

-->

### Writing Issues

<!--- TODO: Example Issue Guides

When creating an issue please try to adhere to the following format:

    module-name: One line summary of the issue (less than 72 characters)

    ### Expected behavior

    As concisely as possible, describe the expected behavior.

    ### Actual behavior

    As concisely as possible, describe the observed behavior.

    ### Steps to reproduce the behavior

    List all relevant steps to reproduce the observed behavior.

-->

### Writing Pull Requests

<!-- TODO: Make a brief statement about where to file pull/merge requests, and conventions for doing so. Link to PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md file.

Comments should be formatted to a width no greater than 80 columns.

Files should be exempt of trailing spaces.

We adhere to a specific format for commit messages. Please write your commit
messages along these guidelines. Please keep the line width no greater than 80
columns (You can use `fmt -n -p -w 80` to accomplish this).

    module-name: One line description of your change (less than 72 characters)

    Problem

    Explain the context and why you're making that change.  What is the problem
    you're trying to solve? In some cases there is not a problem and this can be
    thought of being the motivation for your change.

    Solution

    Describe the modifications you've done.

    Result

    What will change as a result of your pull request? Note that sometimes this
    section is unnecessary because it is self-explanatory based on the solution.

Some important notes regarding the summary line:

* Describe what was done; not the result
* Use the active voice
* Use the present tense
* Capitalize properly
* Do not end in a period â€” this is a title/subject
* Prefix the subject with its scope

    see our .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md for more examples.

## Reviewing Pull Requests

Code Review Example

When you submit a PR to on GitHub it will be reviewed by the project maintainers,
and once changes are approved will be squashed and merged into the main repository.

The changes in the pull request will be collapsed into a single commit, but the
authorship metadata will be preserved.
