For this reason we recommend a two-stage user flow to perform a DDS update: 1) asking the user to connect their account, 2) 60+ minutes later prompting them to return to confirm their new DDS settings. During this interim users should not sign in to their Instacart account outside of Argyle Link.\nHistorical activity retrieval is limited to 2018-01-01.",
