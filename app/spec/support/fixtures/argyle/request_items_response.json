For this reason we recommend a two-stage user flow to perform a DDS update: 1) asking the user to connect their account, 2) 60+ minutes later prompting them to return to confirm their new DDS settings. During this interim users should not sign in to their Instacart account outside of Argyle Link.","status":"healthy","status_details":null,"mapping_status":"verified","logo_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/argyle-media/image/upload/v1713529256/partner-logos/Instacart%20Shopper.png","is_grouping":false},{"id":"item_000024123","name":"Lyft Driver","kind":"gig","known_limitations":null,"status":"healthy","status_details":null,"mapping_status":"verified","logo_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/argyle-media/image/upload/v1678875419/partner-logos/lyft.png","is_grouping":false},{"id":"item_000041078","name":"Uber Driver","kind":"gig","known_limitations":"Uber only makes the last 2 digits of SSN available.
