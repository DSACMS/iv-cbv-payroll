# Environment-specific settings are in this section.
# https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/ruby-agent/configuration/ruby-agent-configuration/
# During deployment, the "/service/${var.app_name}-${var.environment}/new-relic-env" key
# is used to determine the environment that drives NewRelic settings. If the environment
# does not match up it will fail silently and still start, but you won't get logs.

# If your application has other named environments, configure them here.
