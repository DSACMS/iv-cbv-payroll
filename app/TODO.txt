TODO list

-[ ] Tests
-[ ] Implement document_upload_* methods on all activities
-[ ] Add filesize validation
-[ ] Add data-errorMessage (for file format errors)
-[ ] Route user to doc upload after self-attested activities
-[x] Add filetype validation
-[x] Let it take an activity ID rather than using the last EducationActivity
-[x] Make it so uploading another file doesn't clear the files

TBD on design:
-[ ] File input - "x" to remove files
-[ ] File input - prepopulated with previously-uploaded files

Design notes/ideas:
- Can we break out the list of already-uploaded files out of the uploader
  widget? That will make it much cleaner to manage the uploaded files.

- What is the behavior supposed to be regarding the monthly breakdown at the
  top? If the user volunteers for "Food Bank A" in Month 1 and "United Way B"
  in Month 2, how should the monthly breakdown look?

- "Suggested Documents" list for each activity type? Is that copy somewhere?
